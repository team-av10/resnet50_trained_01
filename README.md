# ResNet50 Plant Disease Classification Model

This repository contains a ResNet50 model trained using PyTorch for the classification of various plant diseases and pests. The model is stored as `.pth` files and covers diseases affecting rice, sugarcane, pests, corn, coconut, and banana.

## Model Description

-   **Architecture:** ResNet50
-   **Framework:** PyTorch
-   **Trained On:** A custom dataset of plant disease images.
-   **Classes:**
    -   Rice diseases
    -   Sugarcane diseases
    -   Pests affecting various plants
    -   Corn diseases
    -   Coconut diseases
    -   Banana diseases
-   **Model Files:** `.pth` files for each trained class.


## Requirements

To run the inference script, you need the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
